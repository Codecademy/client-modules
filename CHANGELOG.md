#### use auto for simpler lerna publishing ([#61](https://github.com/Codecademy/client-modules/pull/61))

Utilizes [Auto](https://intuit.github.io/auto/index) to handle versioning/publishing (which uses lerna under the hood). This simplifies a ton of stuff.

1. We don't need to deal with any conventional commits stuff, the version is selected using labels (the labels are already there if you want to check them)
2. Auto handles canary releases (alphas), and adds the versions to the PR description automatically.
3. We can let people merge their own PRs, since `auto` handles generating the changelogs from the PR descriptions.
4. We can add required checks that actually work, now that we don't need to automate merging.
5. We can easily replicate this process across all of our repos that do publishing
