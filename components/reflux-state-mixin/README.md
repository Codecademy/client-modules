# Super Simple Flux

## making Flux look as pretty as React

So - what's this all about?

React is cool - you use this magic `Component` class and jsx, and suddenly all of your view is controlled and changed automatically.
But Flux, on the other hand - is not cool at all, no real code, no api, just good architecture. So then good people said - let's build a nice API for Flux, and suddenly: Redux, Reflux, Alt, Fluxxor etc.

But, If we already have such a great API for React, why can't we do the same with Flux - Stores will control components, the same way Component controls DOM.  You just say the magic word - `setState` - and every thing just happens immediately!

When you make it that simple, it's easy to have all your Components controlled, and then suddenly your Components are purified (functionally speaking), they don't have any "real" state of their own - and as a bonus, you don't care about their hierarchy any more - you can move them around - regardless of their parents and `props`.

So, the requirements for an API like this are straight forward:

1. Stores should control all of the app's state. (This could be done with one main store or not)
2. Easy method called `setState` should change state of Store - no explicit changes (like reducers).
3. Complementary methods could be added - `getInitialState()` ,`shouldStoreUpdate()`, `storeDidUpdate()` - you know the drill.
4. Every state change should notify all Components and force them to re-render (by altering their "controlled" state) - quite similar to what `render` method does.
5. There's an easy way to declare subscriptions of Components to Store's state (or to a specific property of state in Store). Something like `Component.connectTo(Store.someState)`, think about `<input value={this.state.text}/>` for Components.
6. Flux Actions should only notify a Store - do something - and should be blind to what the Store is actually doing - exactly the same as `onChange` from DOM to Component

That's all.

### implementations
Now the implementation could be done any way you want. With Redux, as a new flux library or any other way.

Here I present a mixin for **Reflux** that's working really nice (so nice that according to npm stats, every second reflux user is downloading this), but feel free to add other implementations.
I really hope someone will implement this in **Redux**!

## reflux-state-mixin

Mixins for [reflux](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/reflux), to enable SSF (super simple flux) API


### Installation

```bash
$ npm install reflux-state-mixin --save
```

### in store:

```javascript
// myStore.js
var Reflux = require('reflux');
var StateMixin = require('reflux-state-mixin');
var Actions = require('./../actions/AnimalsActions');

var AnimalStore = module.exports = Reflux.createStore({
  mixins: [StateMixin.store],
  listenables: Actions, //or any other way of listening...

  getInitialState: function(){      //that's a must!
    return{
      dogs:5,
      cats:3
    }
  },

  onNewDogBorn: function() {
        this.setState({dogs: this.state.dogs + 1})
        //just like in a Component.
        //this will `trigger()` this state, similar to `render()` in a Component
  },

  //you can use storeDidUpdate lifecycle in the store, which will get called with every change to the state
  storeDidUpdate: function(prevState) {
      if(this.state.dogs !== prevState.dogs){
        console.log('number of dogs has changed!');
      }
  }


});
```


### in component:


#### 1. the easy way - connect, with mixin or decorator:

```javascript
// PetsComponent.js
var AnimalStore = require('./AnimalStore.js');
var StateMixin = require('reflux-state-mixin');

var PetsComponent = React.createClass({
    mixins:[
        StateMixin.connect(AnimalStore, 'dogs')
        StateMixin.connect(AnimalStore, 'cats')
        //OR
        StateMixin.connect(AnimalStore) //now PetsComponent.state includes AnimalStore.state
        ],

    render: function () {
        return (<div><p>We have {this.state.dogs + this.state.cats} pets</p></div>);
    }
})

```

and if you use React's es6 classes, use the es7 `connector` decorator:

```javascript
import {connector} from 'reflux-state-mixin';
import {AnimalStore} from './AnimalStore';

//@viewPortDecorator // make sure other decorators that returns a Component (usually those who provide props) are above `connector` (since it controls state).
@connector(AnimalStore, 'cats')
@connector(AnimalStore, 'dogs')
//or the entire store
@connector(AnimalStore)
//@autobind //other decorators could be anywhere
class PetsComponent extends React.Component {
    render(){
        let {dogs, cats} = this.state;
        return (<div>We have {dogs + cats} pets</div>);
        }
}

```


#### or if you want to take the long way:
##### listening to a specific property of Store's state

```javascript

var AnimalStore = require('./AnimalStore.js');

var DogsComponent = React.createClass({
    mixins:[Reflux.ListenerMixin],
    getInitialState: function (){
      return({
          dogs:AnimalStore.state.dogs
          //Treat store.state as immutable data - same as you treat component.state -
          //you could use it inside a component, but never change it's value - only with setState()
      })
    },
    componentDidMount: function(){
        this.listenTo(AnimalStore.dogs,this.updateDogs);
        //this Component has no interest in `cats` or any other animal, so it listens to `dogs` changes only
    },
    updateDogs: function(dogs){
        this.setState({dogs:dogs});
        //now we have auto-synchronization with `dogs`, with no need for specific logic for that
    },
    render: function () {
        return (<div><p>We have {this.state.dogs} dogs</p></div>);
    }
});

```
##### listen to an entire store:

```javascript
var AnimalStore = require('./AnimalStore.js');

var PetsComponent = React.createClass({
    mixins:[Reflux.ListenerMixin],
    getInitialState: function (){
      return({
          dogs: AnimalStore.state.dogs,
          cats: AnimalStore.state.cats
      })
    },
    componentDidMount: function(){
         this.listenTo(
            AnimalStore,
            (state)=>{
                this.setState({
                    dogs:state.dogs,
                    cats:state.cats
                })
            });
         //this way the component can easily decide what parts of the store-state are interesting
    },

    render: function () {
        return (<div><p>We have {this.state.dogs + this.state.cats} pets</p></div>);
    }
})
```


## some details
`GetInitialState()` in store should have all of the states from the beginning.
Store should not have any method that are declared in state, since you can listen to MyStore.dogs
`setState()` is checking to see if there is a difference between new `state.key` from current `state.key`. If not, this specific `state.key` it's not triggering.
For any `setState()` the entire store is triggering (regardless of changes), allowing any Component or other Store to listen to the entire Store's state.
