# Codecademy icon font

This is the standard icon font to be used site-wide.
It was generated by [icomoon.io](http://icomoon.io/app) from a bunch of SVG icons.

### Modifying

To modify the `.woff` font file, go to icomoon.io/app.
Click on "New Project", click "Import Icons", and import the `selection.json` in this directory.
You will be able to make changes and re-export it all.

Make sure to update this copy of `source.json` file with the copy you get from the export. Same goes for `demo.html`.
